# Stream Scheduler

A tool that I created for the twitch streamer [nan7s_peluche](https://www.twitch.tv/nan7s_peluche).

It aims to quickly create stream schedules that can be paste on a Discord channel.

No confusion possible: the schedule will be displayed in your own timezone !

## Info

Built using the front-end framework [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

This is the new and updated version 2 rebuilt from the ground up.

The previous version was messy and I didn't felt like working with Svelte again (I despise Svelte 5).
